# A-Frame Art

This is an animated, 3d interpretation of a painting of the moon with some simple, geometric mountains in front. While the composition of the scene is based on the picture, a few changes were made to enhance the relaxing feel of the scene such as animated the background between some night sky themed colors, slowly bobbing the moon up and down, and some music. The triangles forming the mountains are layered in front of one another and are given some depth by placing boxes along their edges. The 3d aspect of the mountains and moon allows the scene to be viewed from different angles, each one providing a different view as if looking towards a range of mountains at different points along the horizon. The scene is best viewed from the area in front of it and not from behind. In addition, a yellow heart of the moon can be spotted inside it. The fast beat of the heart explains the movement of the bigger moon. Also, when the heart is clicked and the browers loads the file after a refresh (tested in Chrome) a sound will appear.
